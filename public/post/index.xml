      <description>I&amp;#39;m spending a little time each day to read some traditional Chinese literature. Recently I&amp;#39;ve been interested in a book that can be dated to the early Zhou dynasty. I Ching was believed (by some) to be written by King Wen of Zhou when he was a prisoner at Youli, apparently before 1000 BC. If it is true, this is currently the oldest book that I&amp;#39;ve ever read.
What I&amp;#39;d like to share today is some comment on the first stacked line of the hexagram qian (䷀) from Confucius.</description>
