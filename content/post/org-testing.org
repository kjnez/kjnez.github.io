Python source:
#+begin_src python
  for i in range(10):
      print(i)
#+end_src

** Embedded LATEX
The radius of the sun is R_sun = 6.96 x 10^8 m. On the other hand,
the radius of Alpha Centauri is R_{Alpha Centauri} = 1.28 x R_{sun}.

\begin{equation}
x = \sqrt{b}
\end{equation}

\(
x = \sqrt{b}
\)

If $a^2 = b$ and \(b = 2\), then the solution must be either $$a = +\sqrt{2}$$ or \[a = -\sqrt{2}\].
